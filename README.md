# Simple Dynamic Website System
Project I did for didactic purposes with procedural PHP.

The MVC standard was used, although without the use of classes.

For the route system, this repository was used: https://github.com/nezamy/route, note that this is the first time I use a system like this, I am still learning.

The page rendering system is the same as that taught by Jo√£o Ribeiro (https://www.youtube.com/user/JLDRPT).

The next step will be to rewrite this system using OO and implement a login system.
